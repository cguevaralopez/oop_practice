# Concepts in Object Oriented Programming
## Class

### '__init__' (initializer)
- Use the '__init__()' function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when
the object is being created


### Attributes (Parameter)
- descriptions of the object
- instance attribute (first_name)
- class - level attribute (WSU)

### Method (Action)
- instance method
    - method that can be performed on the object
- class method
    - allows us to create and modify class level data
- static method
    - does not have access to cls or istance attributes but performs action within the class
- magic method
    -reserved methods that perform a specific task '__str__'

## Inheritance 
- Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
- Parent Class (Student)
- Child Class (Gradtuate Student)

## Polymorphism
- mthods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.
